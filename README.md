# Welcome
This is a simple demo to explore NextJS v5 with support for:
+ SASS
+ TypeScript

## Development
To verify NextJS is running in development mode, you can simply run:
    $ npm run dev

To verify the ExpressJS server is running in development mode, you should be able to see a response from [http://localhost:3000/test](http://localhost:3000/test) to verify the back-end Express server is running.

## Production
To verify NextJS is running in production mode, you can simply run:
    $ npm run start

To verify the ExpressJS server is running in development mode, you should be able to see a response from [http://localhost:3000/test](http://localhost:3000/test) to verify the back-end Express server is running.
